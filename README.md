The Newton iteration for 400 starting points on a circle of radius r = 2 (here for a polynomial of degree 4096, so we do not have enough starting points to find all roots; the polynomial shown
here describes periodic points of period dividing 12 of $`z \to z^2 + i`$). The apparent lines connect orbits under the Newton dynamics;
